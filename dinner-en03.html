<b>“Past Life & Present Stage”</b><br>
The lights rise again for another lifetime.<br>
You and I put on new costumes,<br>
with new faces and voices.<br>
We meet once more among the crowd —<br>
yet only as strangers this time.<br><br>

Maybe there’s a faint stirring inside,<br>
as if we’ve seen this silhouette before.<br>
But we can’t call each other’s names.<br>
So we pass by in the script,<br>
leaving behind words unspoken and a bond unfinished.<br><br>

<b>“Curtain Call — The Soul’s Return”</b><br>
The play ends, the lights dim, and life’s curtain falls.<br>
We set down our roles, remove our masks,<br>
and step off the stage — returning to who we truly are.<br><br>

You walk toward me then, softly calling my forgotten name.<br>
We smile, like actors after the show,<br>
sharing quiet gratitude for every scene we played together.<br><br>

We talk about the story just performed —<br>
who cried, who loved, who erred, who forgave.<br>
Every silent feeling finds its echo<br>
in that reunion beyond the stage.<br><br>

Life cannot be replayed.<br>
Our encounters fade like stage lights after the show.<br>
Yet the soul always remembers —<br>
and meets again when the curtain rises once more.<br><br>

<b>Final note:</b><br>
Life is a play, and every encounter is an unfinished script.<br>
Even when we pass by in different roles,<br>
our souls always recognize each other, after the curtain falls.
