    <p>
      Doing good is to help those still living;<br>
      Chanting scriptures is to comfort the souls still wandering in the dark.<br><br>
      But in truth—<br>
      There is a kind of help that is silent;<br>
      A kind of deliverance that is unseen.<br><br>
      You are not too weak—<br>
      You just haven’t yet believed in your own light.<br><br>
      🌿 A pure heart needs no certificate of rank;<br>
      🕯 Sincerity itself is the most powerful energy.<br><br>
      When you sit quietly and begin to chant,<br>
      You may think you are only calming your own heart.<br><br>
      Yet in that moment,<br>
      There may be souls illuminated by your light—<br>
      Drawing near, listening, and weeping softly.<br><br>
      You might not know it,<br>
      But they remember.<br><br>
      Your one sincere thought<br>
      Becomes their doorway toward the Light.<br><br>
      And when you make a vow within your heart—<br>
      That your good deeds and chanting are not for yourself,<br>
      But for more souls to find light, and more hearts on Earth to feel warmth—<br>
      That is compassion.<br>
      That is the power even the spirit realm responds to.
