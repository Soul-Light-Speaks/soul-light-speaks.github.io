    <p>In many stories, books, and even true accounts,<br>
    people often mention this kind of experience:<br><br>
    A kind person meets an old man or woman on the street.<br><br>
    They might simply ask:<br>
    “Young one, could you help me carry my luggage?”<br>
    “Would you walk with me to the temple?”<br><br>
    And because of this small act of kindness,<br>
    that person narrowly avoids danger or misfortune.<br><br>
    Some believe those elders were not ordinary people—<br>
    perhaps divine beings in disguise,<br>
    or travelers carrying sacred tasks,<br>
    quietly reminding others along the way.<br><br>
    These “small turns” in life<br>
    are often forms of unseen protection<br>
    drawn by the vibration of kindness.<br>
    Every good deed becomes a light that guards you.</p>
