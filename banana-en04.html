    <h1>Life is an exam. Everyone is a test-taker, simply answering a different set of questions.<br>
    A good student is not judged by the difficulty of the test, but by how gracefully they submit their paper.<br>
    Focus on your own answers — there’s no need to compare or copy.<br>
    Even if you can’t finish all the questions in this lifetime, it’s okay — you’ll continue in the next.</h1>

    <p>Coming into this world is like entering an exam hall.<br>
    Every person is a test-taker; every encounter, every relationship, is a question on our paper.<br><br>
    Marriage, for example, is two people studying together — when they separate, there’s no need for resentment.<br>
    It only means one has chosen a new study partner, or to continue the exam alone.<br><br>
    Even revenge, though driven by pain, doesn’t bring true peace.<br>
    These emotions are not punishments but lessons — reminders to release and forgive.<br><br>
    The best we can do is to answer our own test with sincerity and calm.<br>
    Write every line of your paper with awareness, even if there are tears, leave with grace.<br><br>
    Some people chose an easier test — their fate flows smoothly.<br>
    Others chose difficult papers — their lives filled with deep challenges.<br>
    But no test is higher or lower.<br><br>
    A good student is not defined by difficulty, but by honesty, courage, and peace when turning in their work.<br><br>
    Don’t compare, don’t envy.<br>
    Everyone faces different questions. What you envy might be another’s challenge.<br><br>
    Even unfinished tests can be continued in the next lifetime.<br>
    Keep writing — one day, you’ll hand in a paper that fills your soul with quiet joy.</p>
