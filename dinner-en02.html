    <p>Late marriage isn’t a delay of happiness — it’s a respect for growth.<br><br>
    Some marry young because love came fast.<br>
    Some marry late because they’ve learned that love takes time to mature.<br><br>
    When we’re young, we think loving someone is enough.<br>
    But in daily life and conflict, we realize —<br>
    without inner stability, promises can be just emotions in disguise.<br><br>
    Two people who haven’t found their own balance can’t walk far together.<br><br>
    Looking back, we might see —<br>
    perhaps we weren’t ready for marriage back then.<br><br>
    To marry late isn’t to avoid love, but to wait —<br>
    to meet the one who understands your silence<br>
    and can hold your softness without fear.<br><br>
    It’s not postponing love — it’s choosing maturity first.<br><br>
    The one you’ll meet later<br>
    is not just the person who happened to be there,<br>
    but the soul who has grown to walk beside you.<br><br>
    We’re not slow.<br>
    We’re just growing — so that love can finally be steady, not rushed.</p>
