    <p>
      Not every love lesson ends with lifelong companionship.<br>
      Some lessons unfold while being together,<br>
      while others reveal their truth only after parting ways.<br><br>

      Maybe you once met someone like this:<br>
      you kept giving endlessly,<br>
      while they simply received.<br>
      One day you woke up and chose to leave.<br>
      Only then did they realize your worth —<br>
      but for you, the lesson was already complete.<br><br>

      Some people learn love only through loss — that’s their path.<br>
      Others never truly loved; they only enjoyed what you gave.<br>
      These are the “lesson examiners.”<br>
      They come not to love you deeply,<br>
      but to mirror your wounds,<br>
      forcing you to reclaim your love for yourself.<br><br>

      Not every connection brings mutual feeling or pain.<br>
      Some awaken through heartbreak; others drift away untouched.<br>
      Yet, no matter the form,<br>
      once you’ve completed your soul’s lesson,<br>
      every encounter finds its meaning.
