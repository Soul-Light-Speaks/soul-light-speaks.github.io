    <p>
      Not everyone who chooses euthanasia is trying to escape.<br>
      Some have simply been in pain for so long that they’ve forgotten why they came.<br>
      Some have already completed their soul’s lesson in this lifetime,<br>
      and simply choose to “exit” as a way to end their journey.<br><br>
      From the soul’s perspective, this is not “wrong.”<br>
      It’s merely a postponed assignment — to be continued in another form of learning.<br><br>
      It’s not losing. It’s being exhausted.<br>
      The soul will return, in another time and space,<br>
      to complete the unfinished exam with gentler hands.<br><br>
      This is not to encourage early departure.<br>
      It’s a reminder:<br>
      Some people are not “giving up,”<br>
      but have reached a breaking point where even remembering who they are becomes impossible.<br>
      They are not weak — they have simply reached their limit.
